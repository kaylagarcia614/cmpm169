				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The code that I started with came from Xeni on the website openprocessing</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To extend the code I made the movement rely on the position of the mouse</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To innovate this code, I outline the letters with dots that would then start moving with perlin noise</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="3.png">
				<p>then made each dot have a random color</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="4.png">
				<p>made it so when you clicked the mouse it changed the direction of the noise</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="5.png">
				<p>i then removed the background from the draw function so that you can see the black lines when the dots moved</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="6.png">
				<p>i then made it so the dots rotate together</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I contributed to all of the project, with my starting point being from Xeni on the website openprocessing. With the staring code I feel that I was able to make something creative and unique enough to call my own. As I look back at my work as a whole I personally feel that I did a good job. I put a lot of thought and effort into not only coding but also coming up with ideas that seemed fun and exciting. Some brief highs and lows consist of me trying to figure out how to add to a pretty polished piece of work. However once I figured out the direction I wanted to go for this sketch, it was really fun to see what I learned in class be applied to my work.</p>
