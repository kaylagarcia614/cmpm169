			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The code that I started with came from cloud.cb on the website openprocessing </p>
				<p></p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To extend the code I added a new spin pattern and I implemented a color wheel</p>
				<p></p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To innovate this code, I ended up making several different color pallets, so that each time the program was ran it was a different color</p>
				<p></p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="3.png"><img class="me-photo" src="4.png">
				<p>I then realized that this program wasnt interactive enough, so i added the ability to cycle through different pallets by clicking the mouse</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="5.png">
				<p>I then added a trail effect to give the art a nice 3d-ish effect</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="6.png"><img class="me-photo" src="7.png">
				<p>I then added a new mode, where if you press SPACE the rings start to move in a sine wave motion</p>
				<img class="me-photo" src="8.png"><img class="me-photo" src="9.png">
				<p>I then added new movement where it takes all the loops and moves them as one plane in a sine wave motion</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on the whole project, starting with code from cloud.cb on openprocessing. Using that as a base, I made something cool and unique that feels like my own.</p>
					<p>Looking back, I think I did a good job. I put thought and effort into both the code and coming up with fun ideas.</p>
					<p>Upon gaining a clear vision of the direction I intended for the sketch, the process became exceptionally enjoyable. It was a rewarding experience to see my conceptual ideas transform into tangible forms as I diligently worked on the code, bringing the envisioned outcome to life.</p>
				<ul>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>press SPACE for new mode</p>
				<p>TAP mouse for color change</p>
				<p>MOVE mouse to grow/shrink circles</p>
